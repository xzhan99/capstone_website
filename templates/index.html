                collates existing and new tweets which contain health-related information. A user is able to specify the
                type of disease and the application will extract the relevant tweets. Artificial intelligence and/or
                machine learning algorithms will be employed to learn the relevance of tweets based on what users have
                determined to be relevant to them. Tweets that have been presented to be of less significant relevance
                will be classified into other categories or topic of discussion which may be useful later.</p>
